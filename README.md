# Scientific Programming - Weekly Practical Work
This repository contains the practical files for each week separated into its own folder. Each folder contains the code stub for that week's practical problem and a readme.md file with instructions on how to compile and run the .c files. All programs are verified
in sciprog and the output is verified.

Please clone and follow the instructions. Use a GNU compiler to run the programs.
